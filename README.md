# 6) Linkedin Spring Learning Path: Spring: Spring Security - A
## Summary
Code part of course: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/spring-spring-security/


## Topics
1) Form based auth
2) Http basic auth

## Tools
1) spring-boot-starter-security

## Notes
1) Automatically by implementing spring-boot-starter-security dependency 
it enables a form authentication for the entire application using the user 'user' 
and an automatically generated password visible in the console 

2) **antMatchers** allows us to specify the URL that we want to allow.
3) **Basic authentication** is enabled by using httpBasic and it's the old popup instead of a html form.
